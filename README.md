## Installation
From the project root, run the command `npm install` to install all dependencies 
of the project..

## Start
To run the app in the development mode, run the command `npm start`. 
This will start the web app [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Test
Run the command `npm test` to launch the Jest test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) 
for more information.

Run the command `npm run coverage` to get a test coverage analysis of the project.

## Build
Build the app for production to the `build` folder with the command `npm run build`. 
This creates a bundle with React in production mode and optimizes the build for the 
best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## Performance
Build the app for production and run the 
[Webpack analyzer tool](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer).
This will open a local page with an interactive treemap visualization of the contents 
of all your bundles.<br>
