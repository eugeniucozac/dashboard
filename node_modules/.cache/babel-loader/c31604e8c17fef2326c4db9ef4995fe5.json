Having hidden his new lightsaber inside R2-D2, Luke\r\n            frees himself and battles Jabba's guards while Leia uses her chains to strangle Jabba to death. As the others rendezvous with\r\n            the Rebel Alliance, Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his training with Yoda, whom he finds is dying. Yoda confirms that Darth\r\n            Vader, once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and becomes one with the Force. The Force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi\r\n            reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister, and tells Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training and defeat the\r\n            Empire.\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </Box>\r\n        <Box value=\"4\" py={2}>\r\n          <Typography>\r\n            The Trade Federation upsets order in the Galactic Republic by blockading the planet Naboo in preparation for a full-scale\r\n            invasion. The Republic's leader, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, dispatches Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice,\r\n            Obi-Wan Kenobi, to negotiate with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord and the Trade Federation's\r\n            secret benefactor, orders the Viceroy to kill the Jedi and begin their invasion with an army of battle droids. The Jedi escape\r\n            and flee to Naboo. During the invasion, Qui-Gon saves the life of a Gungan outcast, Jar Jar Binks, from being run over by a\r\n            droid transport. Indebted to Qui-Gon, Jar Jar leads the Jedi to Otoh Gunga, an underwater city of Naboo. The Jedi try to\r\n            persuade the Gungan leader, Boss Nass, to help the planet's surface dwellers but are unsuccessful. However, the Jedi manage to\r\n            obtain Jar Jar's guidance and underwater transport to Theed, the capital city of Naboo. They rescue Naboo's queen, Padmé\r\n            Amidala, and escape from the blockaded planet on her Royal Starship, intending to reach the Republic capital planet of\r\n            Coruscant.\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </Box>\r\n        <Box value=\"5\" py={2}>\r\n          <Typography>\r\n            The Galactic Republic is threatened by a Separatist movement organized by former Jedi Master Count Dooku. Senator Padmé Amidala\r\n            comes to Coruscant to vote on a motion to create an army to assist the Jedi against the threat. Narrowly avoiding an\r\n            assassination attempt upon her arrival, she is placed under the protection of Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice\r\n            Anakin Skywalker. The two Jedi thwart a second attempt on her life and subdue the assassin, Zam Wesell, who is killed by her\r\n            employer, a bounty hunter, before revealing his identity. The Jedi Council instructs Obi-Wan to find the bounty hunter, while\r\n            Anakin is tasked to protect Padmé and escort her back to Naboo, where he expresses his romantic feelings for her.\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </Box>\r\n        <Box value=\"6\" py={2}>\r\n          <Typography>\r\n            Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker lead a mission to rescue the kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from the cyborg\r\n            Separatist commander General Grievous. After infiltrating Grievous' flagship, the Jedi battle Count Dooku, whom Anakin\r\n            overpowers and decapitates at Palpatine's urging. Grievous escapes the battle-torn ship, which the Jedi crash-land on Coruscant.\r\n            There, Anakin reunites with his wife, Padmé Amidala, who reveals that she is pregnant. While initially excited, Anakin soon\r\n            begins to have nightmares about Padmé dying in childbirth.\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </Box>\r\n        <Box value=\"7\" py={2}>\r\n          <Typography>\r\n            Thirty years after the Galactic Civil War, the First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to eliminate the\r\n            New Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by General Leia Organa, opposes the First Order.

Against Leia's orders, Poe Dameron leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought.\r\n            The remaining Resistance escapes into hyperspace, but the First Order uses a device to track them, and attacks again. Kylo Ren\r\n            hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother Leia's presence on board, but his wingmen destroy the\r\n            bridge, killing most of the Resistance's leaders. Leia is dragged into space, but survives by using the Force. While Leia\r\n            recovers, Vice Admiral Holdo assumes command of the Resistance.

There, he finds Palpatine, who reveals that he created Snoke as a puppet to control the First Order and lure Kylo\r\n            to the dark side. Palpatine unveils the Final Order—a secret armada of Star Destroyers—and tells Kylo to find and kill Rey, who\r\n            is continuing her Jedi training under Resistance leader Leia Organa. Finn and Poe Dameron deliver intelligence from a spy that\r\n            Palpatine is on Exegol; Rey has learned from Luke Skywalker's notes that a Sith wayfinder can lead them there.
